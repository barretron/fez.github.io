Fix bugs
--------

We try our hardest to write things correctly the first time 
(and we like to think we do a pretty good job of it), but 
like any piece of software there are always bugs. Browse 
the issue tracker at <https://github.com/fez/fez/issues>,
pick something that looks interesting, and get hacking!

Write operations
----------------

The [operations](operations.html) ecosystem is part of what
makes Fez so powerful. There is always space for more
operations and for improvement of existing operations. Is
there something that you would like and doesn't exist yet?
Write it. Or perhaps there is an existing operation which
doesn't have all the features you would like. Submit a pull
request.

The API is simple; you don't have to be a core developer to
understand how to write operations. Take a look at some of
the operations at <http://github.com/fez> to see how it's
done.

Donate
------

We accept donations to fund development. Donations will go
towards commissioning resources like artwork, and enabling
core developers to dedicate time to Fez which would
otherwise go to clients. For now, here's a bitcoin address:

<!-- <script data-gittip-username="isaacbw" src="//gttp.co/v1.js"></script> -->

<div class="bitcoin">14LaXZaTHwGz6dy56qQoSnqTYBuS6BEgqA<img id="copy" class="copy" src="clipboard-1.png" /></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ZeroClipboard.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
 ZeroClipboard.setDefaults({ moviePath: '/js/ZeroClipboard.swf' });
 var clip = new ZeroClipboard(document.getElementById("copy"));
 clip.on("dataRequested", function(client, args) {
   clip.setText("14LaXZaTHwGz6dy56qQoSnqTYBuS6BEgqA");
   document.getElementById("copy").src = "clipboard-checkmark-1.png";
 });
</script>
