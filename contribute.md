Fix bugs
--------

We try our hardest to write things correctly the first time, but like any piece of software there are always bugs.
Browse the issue tracker at <https://github.com/fez/fez/issues>, pick 
something that looks interesting, and get hacking!

Write operations
----------------

The [operations](operations.html) ecosystem is part of what makes Fez so powerful. There is always space for more 
operations and for improvement of existing operations. Is there something that you would like and doesn't exist yet? 
Write it. Or perhaps there is an existing operation which doesn't have all the features you would like. Submit a pull request. 

The API is simple; you don't have to be a core developer to understand how to write operations. Take a look at some of the 
operations at <http://github.com/fez> to see how it's done.

Donate
------

We accept donations to fund development. Donations will go towards commissioning 
resources like artwork, and enabling core developers to dedicate time to Fez which
would otherwise go to clients.
